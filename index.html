        <p>Welcome to the personal website of me, Danny Mickens. <br><br>
           It is a work in progress, but feel free to take a look around. <br>
           If you have been directed to this site to access public programs available
           on my github repository, click <a href="projects.html">here</a> or find the projects
           tab on the navigation bar. <br>
           If you are interested in my resume, there is a downloadable pdf available on the
           <a href="resume.html">resume</a> and a more in depth discussion of my experience
           and skills on the page as well. <br>
           If none of that is there yet, you're probably checking out this page sometime during
           the beginning of June. If that's the case, check back in a few days, or head over
           to my github repository <a href="https://github.com/DannyMickens" target="_blank">with this link</a>
           and you should be able to find some of what you are looking for. <br><br>
           Enjoy your time on the site!

    <h2> TickerTrader </h2>
    <p> TickerTrader is a program that enables stock trading on the command line using
      an Alpaca brokerage account. I was dissatisfied with the amount of time it would
      take me to place orders when scalping very short term. In those scenarios even a few
      seconds matters and having to go through a web interface was just not cutting it. So,
      TickerTrader was born and its designed to need the smallest amount of input possible in
      order to make trades and even allows preset data to further reduce the amount of input needed
      for each trade.

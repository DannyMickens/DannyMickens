    <h1> About Me</h1>
    <br><br>
    <p id="about-body"> My name is Danny Mickens. I am 25 and living in North Carolina.
      In an attempt to not get any other personal location/contact information
      harvested by bots I will leave it at that. <br><br>
      I started creating this website for a few reasons. One, as a developer I've
      always shyed away from anything front end related, worked out of a terminal,
      and focused on function over anything else. This site is helping me sharpen
      (or lets be honest, create for the first time) my web development skills.<br><br>
      Two, from time to time over the course of this pandemic I've put in some hours
      building tools to help me in my trading endeavors. These are public and I want
      others to be able to access them. On this site I will have links to my github
      repositories and use case descriptions. <br><br>
      Lastly, I want this to serve as a portal supporting my career move to software
      development. Along with my public projects I will host a in depth page for my
      resume coupled with a downloadable link. I want this site to show both my personality
      and my knowledge and experience to show how I may fit into the culture of a new
      workplace.
